- **Attack Path Analysis**: Multi-step attack scenario identification
- **Risk Amplification**: How vulnerabilities amplify each other's impact

### 5. AI-Powered Strategic Analysis

Comprehensive AI analysis for strategic insights:

- **Strategic Risk Assessment**: Overall security posture evaluation
- **Attack Scenario Analysis**: Business-impact focused threat modeling
- **Remediation Prioritization**: Cost-benefit analysis of security investments
- **Compliance Considerations**: Regulatory and compliance implications
